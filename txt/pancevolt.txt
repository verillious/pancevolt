Those fools think they can keep it from me. The sanctum. I keep my ear to the ground and my fingers in every pie from here to the fucking bottom of Caer Kilerth. Did they really think that something so powerful would be kept a secret from me?

They know. I've asked one too many questions, snuck out one too many times, creeping through the shifting corridors. They're sending me away. A cleansed. Into the fucking blight.

I'm surrounded by tricksters and snakes. I know it now. I can sense their lies like a whisper in my head. I think they know i can hear them.

Lumiere and the others will burn. Caer Kilerth will burn. The sanctum is mine.






- The Court was set up by one of the Kings of the realm, pre-Blight. It was built originally as royal aide, to try to both record the knowledge of the realm and to provide magical advisors to the Kingsline who would be able to protect the line based on the information they gathered. (Think Little Finger meets the sorcerers in the Witcher meets the cobalt soul)
- It was originally set up in the city of Lorwick which was once the capitol of the known land and was where the Kingsline recided.
- One of these Kings was a closeted follower of the god Soleris (space/dimension), who was known to be a trickster, and requested that the Master Librarians helped him protect the city from any incoming beasts or terrors and they set about researching magics that could help.
- During their research, they managed to develop a portal to an unknown realm but it was unstable and, as the Gods began to war against one another, the portal ripped open and the city of Lorwick was destroyed leaving only the library to remain and most of their research lost.
- The library itself changes shape at will and you must be invited/or a member to locate it. Post war it re-emerged in Caer Kilerth, the city of cathedrals, and claims to be continuing the documenting of the realm and all of it's histories though some believe them to have ulterior motives within their core sanctum. It's also said that time doesn't pass within the core sanctum but the Master Librarians who have access to it are sworn to secrecy.
- Not known whether they are looking for a new Kingsline to serve but to become a member of the court you must defy the Gone Gods who destroyed the world and prove to show no symptoms of blight/be cleansed of otherwordly attachment
