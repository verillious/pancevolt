My name is Pancevolt Libourg Villehardain.

I don't sleep any more, I only dream of the pool, of the stars, of watching Lumiere gasp his last water logged breath in the blackness of this most infernal library's innermost chamber.
I've asked one too many questions, crept through the shifting corridors in the shadow of night once to many times for their liking. They begin to suspect. The Masters - Lumiere and his dicples. I know it now. I can sense their thoughts and fears in the back rooms of my mind.
They're sending me away. A cleansed. Into the blight.

Deception, trickery, these are the qualities of a member of the mad court. Perfect, then, for Pancevolt Libourg Villehardain. I find it hard to beleive that these siccophants really belive in the ideas, the philosophy; and yet here we are - surrounded by fools, gullible belivers. As a child you quickly learn to align yourself with the biggest, stupidest, most easily influenced brute you can find. In my mind, that bully is the Court. Potentially the only one left in this gods-forsaken world. A wise man once said that chaos is a ladder, an oppertunity. When has there ever been more chaos than now?

Even the court has it's snakes however - i'm not the only one to have tasted the scent of oppertunity on my forked tongue.  their lies like a whisper/voice in my head. I think they know i can hear them. Those fools think they can keep it/the pool/the lake of stars from me, but I keep my ear to the ground and my fingers in every pie from here to the fucking bottom of Caer Kilerth. Did they really think that something so powerful would be kept a secret from me?


I have something wrong with my hand. It's nothing im sure. Probably an attempt to poison me. Or a trick.
