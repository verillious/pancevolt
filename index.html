            <!--  I grew up in one of the many small nameless villages in the shadow of Caer Kilerth. As a child I quickly learned to align myself with the biggest, stupidest, most easily influenced bully I could find.

They conspire against me. i'm not the only one to haave tasted oppertunity on my tounge. The Masters - Lumiere and his disciples. I know it now. I can sense their lies like a whisper/voice in my head. They know i can hear them, of course. Those fools think they can keep it/the pool/the lake of stars from me, but I keep my ear to the ground. Did they really think that something so powerful would be kept a secret from me? I'm developing a sixth sense, I dream secret dreams even as I wake. I find it hard to beleive that these siccophants really belive in the ideas, the philosophy; and yet here we are - surrounded by fools, gullible belivers.

I don't sleep, I only dream of the pool, of the stars, of watching lumiere drown in the blackness of the innermost chamber of the library. Something whispers/calls to me. A sixth sense. I dreamt of the pool again. The stars coalleced into a gem of pure glowing light. I reach into the inky water and grasp it. It fragments into infinite glowing particles. I wake. There is something wrong with my hand. It's nothing im sure. Probably an attempt to poison me. Or a trick. It whispers to me sometimes.

They know. I've asked one too many questions, snuck out one too many times, creeping through the shifting corridors. They're sending me away. A cleansed. Into the blight.

It will be fine. My hand told me. -->
